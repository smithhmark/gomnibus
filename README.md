# gomnibus
A collection of collections, in Go

## Organization
This package is currently organized by implementation structure. Eg, implementations based on singly linked lists are in singlelink. 

A __huge__ outstanding issue is how to deal with ADTs and interfaces.

## Structures So Far
 1. Singly-linked list
    1. Stack
    1. Stack-based Queue
 1. Doubly-linked list
    1. Queue
  
## Future structures
 1. The adjacency-list graph from the baby-names-task is a candidate
 1. a Skiplist would be interesting
 1. Tries
    1. character/rune-based for strings
    1. something more general...
